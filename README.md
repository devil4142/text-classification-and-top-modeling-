# Problem Statement 

FashionKart allows consumers to buy latest products from e-commerce platforms. Customers can leave reviews of products and experience to help other users make their purchase choices.

Given the dataset of product reviews and recommendation status, build a text classification model that can correctly identify the users who will recommend the product in the future. Also provide key topics/themes emerging from the customer reviews along with visualisation charts.
